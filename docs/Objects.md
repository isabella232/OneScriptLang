# Objects

> For full information please [click here](README.md)

OneScript supports the idea of modular development and reusable code. In order to achieve this all source code is compiled into objects that can ultimately be linked together into a OneScript executable image.

Objects are produced in a binary format that need to linked together for final execution by the OneScript Runtime.
