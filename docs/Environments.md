A compiled OneScript program can be deployed to the Macro Virtual Machine that resides on different platforms:
* Windows for server side surveys and quota analysis. This means it can be run in a pure process or as part of a web service for surveys.
* iOS for local app surveys
* Android for app surveys

The Macro Virtual Machine is open source and available for translation over to any platform that support c++.
